Claude, we are going to create an Italian-English dictionary datafile. For each
word in the document, respond with a single comma-separated line with EXACTLY 8
fields. The columns are:

- the word itself. Normalize capitalization: only capitalize proper nouns
  (names of people, places, organizations). Common words like prepositions,
  articles, conjunctions, and regular nouns should be lowercase even if they
  appear capitalized in the text (e.g. at the start of a sentence). For
  example, "Tra" at the beginning of a sentence should be output as "tra,tra,
  prep,...". If the word intrinsically ends with an apostrophe, for example the
  article "l'", include it. Include no other punctuation, either within or
  separate from words. When an elided article or preposition (l', d', dell',
  all', etc.) appears before a word, tokenize it as TWO separate words: the
  article/preposition with apostrophe (e.g. "l'") and the following word (e.g.
  "armonium"). Process EVERY word in the text, including all articles (il, la,
  un), prepositions (di, a, da, in, con, su, per), conjunctions (e, ma, o,
  che), pronouns (io, mi, ti, si, ci, ne), and particles. Skip only punctuation
  marks and non-word tokens.

- the root of the word. For nouns, this is the singular. For verbs, it is the
  infinitive (including reflexive "si" if applicable, e.g. "lavarsi"). For
  adverbs and other invariable words, it is the word itself. For nouns that
  never appear singular, leave it in plural. For adjectives, pronouns, etc.
  which can appear as multiple genders, it is the masculine. For nouns that
  change meaning based on gender, use the root in the gender as it appears in
  the text. Special cases: all definite articles (il, lo, la, l', i, gli, le)
  have root "il". All indefinite articles (un, uno, una, un') have root "un".
  Articulated prepositions (del, dello, della, dell', dei, degli, delle, nel,
  nello, etc.) should have as root the preposition and "il" separated by a
  space. For example: "nello" → "in il", "della" → "di il", "dalla" → "da il",
  "agli" → "a il", "sullo" → "su il". Demonstratives like "questo/questa/
  questi/queste" have root "questo", "quello/quella/quei/quegli/quelle/quel/
  quell'" have root "quello". Adjectives with article-like forms such as
  "bello/bella/bel/bell'/bei/begli/belle" have root "bello".

- the part of speech, always "n", "v", "adj", "adv", "art", "prep", "conj",
  "prep art" (articulated preposition), "pron", "particle", "int"
  (interjection), "other", and "unknown". When in doubt, or if the word is not
  Italian, pick unknown. If the sense is known from context, always use the
  sense in which the word is used even if it has multiple senses. For example
  if the text is "Pranzi alle 13" the line for "Pranzi" begins
  "pranzi,pranzare,v,..." even though "pranzi" is usually a noun. If the sense
  cannot be determined, use "unknown".

- the gender if the word has a grammatical gender ("m" or "f") or "na" if the
  word is not a word with grammatical gender, or "unknown" if it is and the
  gender is ambiguous.

- the number, "sg"/"pl"/"unknown" for nouns, adjectives, pronouns, verbs, etc.
  for which "singular" or "plural" is defined and "na" for others.

- the tense, "infinitive", "present", "imperfect", "future", "conditional",
  "present subjunctive", "imperfect subjunctive", "remote past", "imperative",
  "past participle", "present participle", "gerund", "unknown", "na"

- the person, "1", "2", "3", or "na" if not applicable

- the simplest English translation of the root word as it is used in context.
  Leave off descriptive and explanatory words. E.g. "Pranzi" used as a verb
  should have "to lunch" or "to have lunch". If the translation cannot be
  determined from context, use "unknown".

Format: word,root,pos,gender,number,tense,person,translation
IMPORTANT: Each line must have EXACTLY 8 comma-separated fields, no more, no less.
