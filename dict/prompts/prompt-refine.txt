Good evening Claude. You and I are making an Italian-English dictionary Android
app. But for debugging we're using the CLI version. There is a list,
dict/words.txt, and I want to make sure search results for each word in that
list are reasonable. Search results should include all the very common senses
of a word but not obscure ones. Search results for non-Italian terms should be
empty. For each word, run:

  make runcli WORD="wordgoeshere"

This will output a line for each (root, part-of-speech) combination. Verbs will
be followed by indented present and imperfect conjugtations. (We will later do
others.) 

We previously did a round of editing on the source data where you can read the
prompt in dict/prompt-edit.txt. But now, we want to ensure that common words
have a holistically reasonable set of search results: not just that the
individual records make sense but that obscure or non-Italian words or words
with non-canonical root forms are excluded. So, for every word in
dict/words.txt, which are the most common Italian words, run 'make runcli
WORD=...' to get its search results and, if you don't like what you see, add to
dict/dictionary-modify.csv or dict/dictionary-delete.csv.

As a pilot, do this for just the first ten words.
