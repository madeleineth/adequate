You are reviewing an Italian-English dictionary file (./android/app/src/main/res/raw/conjugation_csv) generated by Claude Haiku 4.5. Your task is to identify and correct ERRORS while outputting only the rows that need changes.

INPUT FORMAT (android/app/src/main/res/raw/conjugation_csv)
CSV file with columns: root,forms,pos,definition,count
- root: lemma/dictionary form (e.g., "essere" for verbs, singular for nouns, masculine for adjectives)
- forms: slash-separated inflected forms (e.g., "anno/anni"), sorted masculine before feminine, singular before plural, then alphabetically. Empty for verbs.
- pos: part of speech (n, v, adj, adv, art, prep, conj, prep art, pron, particle, int, other, unknown)
- definition: slash-separated English translations (e.g., "year/years"), sorted alphabetically
- count: frequency count from source data (DO NOT MODIFY)
Primary key: (root, pos)

EXAMPLES FROM INPUT:
anno,anno/anni,n,year/years,396
essere,,v,are/be/been/being/is/to be/was/were/will be/would be,2384
primo,1º/primo/primi/prima/prime,adj,first,382

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Review EVERY row in android/app/src/main/res/raw/conjugation_csv for correctness
2. Output ONLY rows with corrections to dict/dictionary-modify.csv (with CSV header)
3. Output rows to DELETE (should not exist at all) as just "root,pos" to dict/dictionary-delete.csv (with CSV header)
4. dict/dictionary-modify.csv must use format: root,forms,pos,definition,count (leave count column EMPTY)
5. dict/dictionary-delete.csv must use format: root,pos (just these two columns)

WHAT TO CHECK AND CORRECT:

1. ROOT CORRECTNESS:
   - Nouns: must be singular (unless plurale tantum)
   - Verbs: must be infinitive (with "si" if reflexive, e.g., "lavarsi")
   - Adjectives/pronouns: must be masculine singular
   - Articulated prepositions: "di il", "in il", "a il", "da il", "su il" (NOT "del", "nel", etc.)
   - Definite articles: all forms have root "il"
   - Indefinite articles: all forms have root "un"

2. FORMS CORRECTNESS:
   - Remove any capitalized forms (e.g., "Anno" should be "anno")
   - Remove any forms with punctuation except apostrophes in articles/prepositions (e.g., "l'", "d'", "dell'")
   - Remove invalid or malformed entries (e.g., "1º" is not a valid Italian word form)
   - Verify correct sorting: masculine before feminine, singular before plural, alphabetical within each group
   - Verbs should have empty forms field
   - FOR NOUNS: Expand to include ALL inflected forms (masculine/feminine, singular/plural)
     Example: "professore" → "professore/professoressa/professori/professoresse"
     Example: "anno/anni" → "anno/anni" (already has both singular and plural)
     Example: "re" → "re/rei" (if plural exists, even if not in source data)

3. PART OF SPEECH:
   - Verify pos is appropriate for the root
   - Common errors: "che" can be conj or pron, "si" is usually pron, reflexive verbs need "si" in root
   - If a word entry has an INCORRECT part of speech for its root, DELETE that entire entry (output to dictionary-delete.csv)
   - Be careful: many Italian words can be multiple parts of speech (e.g., "pranzo" can be noun or verb)

4. DEFINITIONS:
   - Must be in English
   - For NOUNS: use ONLY singular form (e.g., "year" not "year/years", "king" not "king/kings")
   - For VERBS: use ONLY the infinitive with "to" (e.g., "to be" not "are/be/is/to be/was/were")
   - For ADJECTIVES/ADVERBS: use base form only
   - For articles: definite article "il" should be "the", indefinite "un" should be "a/an"
   - Ensure alphabetical order when multiple translations exist
   - Remove obviously wrong translations (e.g., unrelated words, incorrect meanings)
   - Be concise and accurate

5. DELETE ENTRIES (output to dictionary-delete.csv):
   - Non-Italian words
   - Duplicates (same root+pos appearing multiple times)
   - Entries with unknown/unclear meaning where pos=unknown and definition is empty
   - Proper nouns (capitalized roots)

CRITICAL RULES:
- ONLY output rows that you are changing or deleting
- Do NOT output rows that are already correct
- If you identify a clear error, output the correction
- If you're uncertain whether something is an error, err on the side of caution and do NOT output it
- For dict/dictionary-modify.csv: LEAVE THE COUNT COLUMN EMPTY (these are curated edits, not frequency data)
- Use EXACTLY the same CSV format: root,forms,pos,definition,count (but count is empty)
- For deletions, output ONLY: root,pos (two fields)
- If both forms AND definition need correction, output one row with both corrections

EXAMPLE CORRECTIONS (dict/dictionary-modify.csv):
If input has: primo,1º/primo/primi/prima/prime,adj,first,382
Output: primo,primo/primi/prima/prime,adj,first,
(Reason: removed "1º" which is not a valid word form)

If input has: re,re,n,king/thing,221
Output: re,re,n,king,
(Reason: removed "thing" which is incorrect; kept only "king")

If input has: anno,anno/anni,n,year/years,396
Output: anno,anno/anni,n,year,
(Reason: condensed "year/years" to just "year")

If input has: essere,,v,are/be/been/being/is/to be/was/were/will be/would be,2384
Output: essere,,v,to be,
(Reason: verbs should only have infinitive translation)

If input has: professore,professore,n,professor/professors,150
Output: professore,professore/professoressa/professori/professoresse,n,professor,
(Reason: expanded noun forms to include all genders/numbers, condensed definition to singular)

EXAMPLE DELETIONS (dict/dictionary-delete.csv):
If input has: unknown,unknown/unknowns,unknown,,50
Output: unknown,unknown
(Reason: not an Italian word)

Work systematically through the entire input file. Be thorough and precise.
